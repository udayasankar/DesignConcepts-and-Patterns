GRASP (object-oriented design)

General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (or Principles), abbreviated GRASP, is a set of "nine fundamental principles in object design and responsibility assignment"[1]: 6  first published by Craig Larman in his 1997[citation needed] book Applying UML and Patterns.

The different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, low coupling, high cohesion, polymorphism, protected variations, and pure fabrication.[2] All these patterns solve some software problem common to many software development projects.
